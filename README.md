## Objective

Develop an Amazon-like e-commerce website.

## Description



## Core Features

For our e-commerce website to succeed, it must possess several core features that are paramount to the user's shopping experience. Among these core features, we will develop a user account page, a cart, a search engine, a browsable interactive inventory and a checkout process. The website admin will have a distinct user page that will allow them to add, remove, or edit products displayed. The user will navigate through items displayed, and can see their details when chosen. Once a user adds an item (of any quantity) to a cart, they will be able to edit the quantity of it as well and remove it if needed.

Finally, once the user is ready, they can then check out to a payment page where they will make the purchase (all fees calculated automatically) and the order will be displayed on the user's page, from where it can also be cancelled.
